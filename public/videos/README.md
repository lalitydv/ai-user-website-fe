# Video Background Files

To add a video background to the footer, place your video files here:

1. `footer-bg.mp4` - Main video file (MP4 format)
2. `footer-bg.webm` - WebM format for better browser compatibility

## Video Requirements:

- Recommended resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
- Format: MP4 and WebM
- Duration: 10-30 seconds (will loop)
- File size: Keep under 5MB for better performance
- Content: Abstract, tech-related, or gradient animations work well

## Alternative Options:

If you don't have video files, you can:

1. Use a gradient animation with CSS
2. Use a static image with overlay
3. Use a GIF file

The footer component will automatically fall back to a solid background if no video files are found.
